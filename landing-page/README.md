## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the Udacity Classroom.

## Modifications

Based on the starter project files I added the app's functionality as main functions for
* building the navigation based on sections using id and data-nav attributes
* scrolling to the appropriate section when click on a menu item happens
* changing the status of a section when scrolled into view

In addition, I have added some helper functions to reuse and avoid duplicate code. 

## Integration

The Landing Page Project is part of all my projects residing at [GitHub](*https://github.com/MHundeloh.github.io)
